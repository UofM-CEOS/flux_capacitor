** Preliminary list of fields

*** time

This will be a timestamp field, common to all files.

data for each set of files.  This field is reported in MET and EC files.

This field is reported in MET and RAD files.  Is the value of this field
the same in both sets of files?  I don't think so, as they are different
data loggers.

Units: C

Referred to as "panel_temperature" in the files/code.  This field is
reported in MET and RAD files.  Is the value of this field the same in both
sets of files?

where it is recorded by a sonic anemometer, both as serial and analogue
form.

This is referred to as "rh_percent" in the files/code I've seen.  This
field is reported in MET files only.

files only, and comes from an IR transducer.

sampling interval.  This field is reported in MET files only.
