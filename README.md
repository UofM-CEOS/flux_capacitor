# Flux capacitor

Routines and tools to process flux (eddy covariance) data as collected by
our group.

Material under the Templates directory, as well as *.pro files are for the legacy IDL programming language.  The newer tools are being written in Python and Matlab.

For those using the IDL tools: make sure the Astrolib and Coyote libraries
are in IDL's path.
